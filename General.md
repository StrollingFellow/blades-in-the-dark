# The Score

#### Plus One Die

- Bold or Daring Operation
- Does it target a particular weakness of the target?
- Can any friends or contacts provide aid or insight?

#### Minus One Die

- Overly complex or contingent on many factors
- Is the target strong against the approach?
- Are enemies or rivals interfering?

Check for any additional factors you can think of!
